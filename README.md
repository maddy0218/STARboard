## About 

STARboard is a teaching assistant management website. Madelyn Lecsek (myself), Chloe Pappas, and Gwynn McKechnie built STARboard from scratch as a final project for COMP307 (Web Development) at McGill. 

## Motivation and lessons learned

The story board for this website was given to us as part of an assignment. However, our team was mainly motivated to work on this project as a way to gain experience with web development using a SQL database. This website taught us alot about using SQL databases, PHP, Javascript, responsive design, and tickets/webpage security.
